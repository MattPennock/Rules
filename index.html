        <li>Every day is leg day.</li>
        <li>Don’t talk to girls at practice; that would be weird.</li>
        <li>Did you see workout Wednesday?</li>
        <li>A Curtain Push doesn’t count if freshman in East don’t see it.</li>
        <li>There are five hills on Four Hills, deal with it.</li>
        <li>As you pass pedestrians: hold your breath, step lightly and enter stealth mode in order to scare the shit out of them as your glorious quads float you along.</li>
        <li>Oh, you want to run with us next year? See you never…</li>
        <li>Thinking about getting into Ultra-Marathons? Stop.</li>
        <li>Practice starts late with the announcements of today’s runs, and ends when you decide to skip abs.</li>
        <li>Tempo pace is 100% of Race Pace.</li>
        <li>Humps are for camels, no hydration packs.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s splits, bring your own GPS or go without.</li>
        <li>Livestrong bracelets are cock-rings for your arms.</li>
        <li>On easy days ask yourself: “What would Steve Senick do?” and drop the hammer!</li>
        <li>Shut Up Lacy.</li>
        <li>Peter Lin is the President of my heart, now and forever.</li>
        <li>BradBradBradBradBradBradBradBradBradBradBradBrad.</li>
